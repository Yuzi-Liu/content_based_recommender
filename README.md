# content_based_recommender
Goal: Construct a recommender system.  

In the dataset, there are data of ingredients/ recipes, and interactions. Deliverable: Given a (user_id and recipe_id), predict the rating. Trying to minimize MSE (Mean Squared Error) 

The logic is: I want to recommend the dishes that have similar ingredients or recipes etc. with the dishes that a user rates high, which means the user likes the dish.
